  section](https://github.com/aDotInTheVoid/hyde/commit/5e03b8231a92d217c949bcd0c050372b3190a636)

    sidebar](https://github.com/aDotInTheVoid/hyde/commit/532a9d455439e1abd18d913e4b0ac2d138c03033):
    The site name above does that

  type](https://github.com/aDotInTheVoid/hyde/commit/d88b6c98164bea424214ef0f5bf79e2236695a79):

  and `.../foo/bar` to both look like a single, `.../foo/_index.md` should have
  `type: not_a_list`
